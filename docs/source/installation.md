# Installation
For the installation and usage of the framework Python 3.6 or higher is needed.
We *highly* encourage the use of a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html)
or a [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) environment:

```shell
# virtual environment 
~/test$ python3 -m venv SimPhoNy
~/test$ source SimPhoNy/bin/activate
(SimPhoNy) ~/test$ 
```

```shell
# conda
~/test$ conda create -n <env name>
~/test$ conda activate <env name>
```

```eval_rst
.. Note::
   The ``git clone`` commands used in the next subsections assume a proper 
   `configuration of ssh keys <https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh>`_.
   Please use the commented *https* versions otherwise.

```
## OSP-core installation
First, the repository must be cloned:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:simphony/osp-core.git
# git clone https://github.com/simphony/osp-core.git
cd osp-core
```

The installation is based on setuptools:

```sh
# build and install (recommended)
pip install .

# alternative
python3 setup.py install
```

or:

```sh
# build for in-place development (recommended)
pip install -e .

# alternative
python3 setup.py develop
```

After installing OSP-core, you can install your ontology namespaces.
We provide the tool [`pico`](./utils.md#pico-installs-cuds-ontologies)
(**p**ico **i**nstalls **c**uds **o**ntologies) for that purpose.

```sh
pico install <path/to/ontology.yml>

# If you have issues using pico directly, you can use
python -m osp.core.pico install <path/to/ontology.yml>
```

## Wrapper installation
The installation of a wrapper is similar. First, the repository is cloned:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:simphony/<some-wrapper>.git
# git clone https://github.com/simphony/<some-wrapper>.git
cd some-wrapper
```
### Local wrapper installation
With OSP-core installed, if the wrapper has its own ontology, it *must* be installed:

```shell
pico install <path/to/ontology.yml>
```

For the wrappers that require the installation of a backend, a `install_engine.sh` script is provided.
It will automatically call `install_engine_requirements.sh`, where the engine specific requirements are installed.

```shell
./install_engine.sh
```

Now the wrapper can be installed:

```shell
python3 setup.py install
```

### Wrapper Docker image
Some wrappers also provided a [Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/)
for an automatic installation in a container.
Simply run the `docker_install.sh` script. There is no need to install OSP-core either.

```shell
./docker_install.sh
```
