## Semantic layer

The semantic layer is the representation of the classes of the ontology in a programming language.

When the user installs an ontology through `pico`,
all ontology concepts are saved in a graph in `~/.osp_ontologies`.

The procedure is as follows:

- The `OntologyInstallationManager` receives a list of yml files with ontologies to install.
- It instantiates a `Parser`.
- The parser goes through the ontologies and creates an `OntologyClass` per entity.
- All the oclasses of the same namespace are grouped in an `OntologyNamespace`.
- All the registries are collected in the `NamespaceRegistry`.

Installing new ontologies loads the graph and adds new namespaces or modifies the existing ones.

When a class is instantiated, an individual is created.
The graph is read, and an instance of the [Cuds](#cuds) class with the ontology information is created.

Through the Cuds they realise the [Cuds API](#cuds-api) which enables the user to work with them in a generic, simple way.

### Cuds

_Location:_ `osp.core.cuds`

It is the base class for all instances.
Besides whatever might have been defined in the ontology, they all have 3 basic attributes:

- uid: instance of `uuid.UUID`, it serves to uniquely identify an instance.
- session: this is the link to the interoperability layer.
  By default all objects are in the `CoreSession`, unless they are in a wrapper.
- oclass: indicates the ontology class they originate from.

#### Cuds structure

Each cuds object contains the uids and oclass of the directly related entities,
as well as the relationship that connects them.
The actual related objects are kept in the [registry](#registry).

```
 a_cuds_object :=  {
    Relation1: {uid1: oclass, uid2: oclass},
    Relation2: {uid4: oclass},
    Relation3: {uid3: oclass, uid5: oclass},
    }
```

```{note}
   This is an abstraction to show the general structure.
   The actual implementation is a bit more complex.
```

#### Cuds API

The governing idea behind the API design was to simplify as much as possible the usage.

This CRUD API is defined by 6 methods:

##### Create

```python
from osp.core.namespaces import some_namespace

ontology_class = some_namespace.OntologyClass
relationship = some_namespace.relationship
cuds_obj = some_namespace.OntologyClass()
```

##### Add

```python
# These will also add the opposed relationship to the new contained cuds object
cuds_obj.add(*other_cuds, rel=relationship)
cuds_obj.add(yet_another_cuds)  # Uses default relationship from ontology
```

The flow of information for the call of the `add` method would be:

```{uml}
  :caption: add method call
  :align: center

  skinparam {
  Shadowing false
  BackgroundColor transparent
  sequenceBoxBackgroundColor #9FC6DE
  sequenceBoxBorderColor black
  ActorBackgroundColor transparent
  ActorBorderColor #179c7d
  ParticipantBackgroundColor #E3E3E3
  ParticipantBorderColor black
  DatabaseBackgroundColor transparent
  DatabaseBorderColor #179c7d
  SequenceLifeLineBorderColor #179c7d
  ArrowColor #179c7d
  }

  actor user
  box "Semantic Layer"
    participant "cuds" as cuds
  end box

  box "Interoperability Layer"
    participant "session" as sess
  end box

  box "Syntactic Layer"
    participant "engine" as eng
  end box

  database "backend" as back

  user -> cuds: add
  cuds <- sess: load
  cuds -> sess: store
```

As you can see, the information is sent to the next layer, but not all the way to the backend.
This will be propagated when the user calls `session.run()` or `session.commit`.
The registry is checked for a pre-existing object, in case something that is already there is being added.

##### Get

```python
# Returns a list, unless only one uid was given
cuds_obj.get()                                           # All the contained cuds objects
cuds_obj.get(rel=relationship)                           # Entities under that relationship
cuds_obj.get(*uids)                                      # Searches elements for the uids
cuds_obj.get(*uids, rel=relationship)                    # Faster, filters by relationship
cuds_obj.get(oclass=ontology_class)                      # Elements of that class
cuds_obj.get(rel=relationship, oclass=ontology_class)    # Filters by rel and oclass
```

In this case, the calls carried out by the `get` method are as follows:

```{uml}
:caption: get method call
:align: center

skinparam {
Shadowing false
BackgroundColor transparent
sequenceBoxBackgroundColor #9FC6DE
sequenceBoxBorderColor black
ActorBackgroundColor transparent
ActorBorderColor #179c7d
ParticipantBackgroundColor #E3E3E3
ParticipantBorderColor black
DatabaseBackgroundColor transparent
DatabaseBorderColor #179c7d
SequenceLifeLineBorderColor #179c7d
ArrowColor #179c7d
}

actor user
box "Semantic Layer"
  participant "cuds" as cuds
end box

box "Interoperability Layer"
  participant "session" as sess
end box

box "Syntactic Layer"
  participant "engine" as eng
end box

database "backend" as back

user -> cuds: get
cuds -> sess: load

== Object not in registry ==
sess -> eng: _load_from_backend
eng -> back: <get info>
back --> eng: <info>
eng --> sess: <info>
== Object in registry ==
sess --> cuds: object
cuds --> user: object
```

Now the backend is contacted to make sure the user receives the latest
available version of the objects being queried.
This is done through `_load_from_backend()`.

##### Update

```python
# Objects to update must exist already
cuds_obj.update(*cuds_objs)
```

A simple `update` call triggers the following behaviour:

```{uml}
:caption: update method call
:align: center

skinparam {
Shadowing false
BackgroundColor transparent
sequenceBoxBackgroundColor #9FC6DE
sequenceBoxBorderColor black
ActorBackgroundColor transparent
ActorBorderColor #179c7d
ParticipantBackgroundColor #E3E3E3
ParticipantBorderColor black
DatabaseBackgroundColor transparent
DatabaseBorderColor #179c7d
SequenceLifeLineBorderColor #179c7d
ArrowColor #179c7d
}

actor user
box "Semantic Layer"
  participant "cuds" as cuds
end box

box "Interoperability Layer"
  participant "session" as sess
end box

box "Syntactic Layer"
  participant "engine" as eng
end box

database "backend" as back

user -> cuds: update
cuds <- sess: load()
cuds -> sess: store()
```

You can see the calls are very much the same as with the `add` method.
The difference is that the `update` requires the object to be there previously.
And so the object is first loaded from the registry, then updated and stored.

##### Remove

```python
# These will trigger the update in the opposed relationship of the erased element
cuds_obj.remove()                                        # Remove all
cuds_obj.remove(*uids/cuds_objs)                         # Remove objects with the given uids
cuds_obj.remove(*uids/cuds_objs, rel=relationship)       # Faster, filters by relationship
cuds_obj.remove(rel=relationship)                        # Delete all elements under a relationship
cuds_obj.remove(oclass=ontology_class)                   # Delete all elements of a certain class
cuds_obj.remove(rel=relationship, oclass=ontology_class) # Delete filtering by rel and oclass
```

The sequence for a simple `remove` is:

```{uml}
:caption: remove method call
:align: center

skinparam {
Shadowing false
BackgroundColor transparent
sequenceBoxBackgroundColor #9FC6DE
sequenceBoxBorderColor black
ActorBackgroundColor transparent
ActorBorderColor #179c7d
ParticipantBackgroundColor #E3E3E3
ParticipantBorderColor black
DatabaseBackgroundColor transparent
DatabaseBorderColor #179c7d
SequenceLifeLineBorderColor #179c7d
ArrowColor #179c7d
}

actor user
box "Semantic Layer"
  participant "cuds" as cuds
end box

box "Interoperability Layer"
  participant "session" as sess
end box

box "Syntactic Layer"
  participant "engine" as eng
end box

database "backend" as back

user -> cuds: remove
cuds <- sess: load()
cuds -> cuds: remove_rel()
```

Here the registry is accessed to fetch the neighbours of the removed object
and delete their links (relationships) to it.

##### Iterate

```python
cuds_obj.iter()                                          # Iterates through all
cuds_obj.iter(oclass=ontology_class)                     # Iterates filtering by the ontology class
cuds_obj.iter(rel=relationship)                          # Iterates filtering by the relationship
```

The general behaviour of the `iter` is:

```{uml}
:caption: iter method call
:align: center

skinparam {
Shadowing false
BackgroundColor transparent
sequenceBoxBackgroundColor #9FC6DE
sequenceBoxBorderColor black
ActorBackgroundColor transparent
ActorBorderColor #179c7d
ParticipantBackgroundColor #E3E3E3
ParticipantBorderColor black
DatabaseBackgroundColor transparent
DatabaseBorderColor #179c7d
SequenceLifeLineBorderColor #179c7d
ArrowColor #179c7d
}

actor user
box "Semantic Layer"
  participant "cuds" as cuds
end box

box "Interoperability Layer"
  participant "session" as sess
end box

box "Syntactic Layer"
  participant "engine" as eng
end box

database "backend" as back

user -> cuds: iterate
cuds <- sess: load()
cuds -> user: yield(object)
```

First the uids of all the objects to be iterated are gathered,
and then they are yielded like a generator

```{hint}
   There is also an `is_a` method for checking oclass inheritance.
```

```{note}
   Be aware that the sequence diagrams shown represent simple use cases,
   and more complex scenarios are also possible (e.g. adding an object with children).
```

## Interoperability layer

The interoperability layer takes care of the connection and translation between the semantic and syntactic parts.
It also contains the storage of all the objects that share a session.

### Registry

_Location:_ `osp.core.session.registry`

This flat datastructure stores all the objects in the same workspace (session) by their uid.
It is accessed through the session, and invisible to the user.

It also has functionality for pruning, resetting, or filtering its elements.

### Session

_Location:_ `osp.core.session`

The main purpose of session objects is to propagate the changes introduced by the user (and stored in the registry)
to the backend, and update the registry with the modifications coming from the backend.

The backend is accessed via the Syntactic layer, through the `_engine` property.

To simplify and group functionality, we built an inheritance scheme:

```{note}
   This is a reduced version and does not represent the entirety of the contained functions.
```

The simplest session, called `CoreSession`, is the default one for entities created in a python workspace
and has no backend. It just accesses the registry to manage the operations made by users.

All wrappers will share `WrapperSession` as an ancestor.
This will define which methods have to be implemented and `_engine` as the access point to a backend.

`SimWrapperSession` and `DbWrapperSession` further specify the behaviour of wrappers, defining the methods that
trigger an action on the backend (`run` and `commit`, respectively).

```{note}
   You might have noticed that the semantic layer defines `remove` in the API,
   but in the session and registry we use `delete`. The different between them
   is conceptual: `remove` is interpreted as detachment i.e. removal of edges,
   while `delete` implies the erasure of the node itself.
```

#### Buffers

Session classes under `WrapperSession` share 3 types of buffers, namely `added`, `updated` and `deleted`.
The previous buffers are repeated twice, first for the user and then for the engine,
so the number of buffers is actually 6.

As we have seen in the previous section, not all API calls trigger a change all the way to the backend.
In fact, most of them do not. This is done to limit the traffic in the slower sections
(networking or communicating with the engine).

On the other hand, the user should be able to access the latest version of the data
(meaning the changes they might have just done), and the wrapper should know what changes have taken place
since the last sync with the backend software (`commit` or `run`).
In order to achieve these, the changes done by the user directly modify the semantic layer and are
flagged in the buffers as changes to be propagated

Users or wrapper developers do not have to worry about updating this buffers, OSP-core handles them
(both filling them up and emptying them).

However, these structures will be used in the different `_apply_<buffer>` methods when developing a wrapper
(see [this](./wrapper_development.md#coding) section of wrapper development).

#### Load from Backend

Similar to how the `_apply_<buffer>` methods are used to send information to the engine,
`_load_from_backend` has the purpose of updating the semantic layer with the latest information from the backend.

You can see in the [`get` sequence diagram](#get) that when the information has potentially
changed in the backend (i.e the simulation has run, or a database has more data)
the `get` has to fetch the latest version.
To achieve this, OSP-core calls `_load_from_backend` with the list of desired uids,
and the wrapper wrapper will update the objects in the registry with the relevant
information and `yield` them.

### Networking

_Location:_ `osp.core.session.transport`

You may have noticed in the [session inheritance scheme](#session) that there is `TransportSession` implementing the `WrapperSession`.
This session class is the way to connect to engines that are located in other machines through web sockets.

The behaviour is as follows:

- The user instantiates a `TransportSessionClient` and provides
  the session class of the remote server, the hostname and the port.
- The `TransportSessionClient` will connect to a `TransportSessionServer`
  through a `CommunicationEngineClient`.
- The server has the wrapper package installed locally.
- `CommunicationEngineClient` and `CommunicationEngineServer` (one on each side)
  take care of the communication, so that:
  - The methods that the user would call on the remote wrapper are encoded
    with the relevant data (in json) and sent to the server.
  - The server deserialises the data and calls the method on the wrapper.
  - The results are serialised and sent back to the user´s local transport session.

The chosen implementation hides most of the work from the users and wrapper developers.
The only difference between a local wrapper and a remote one is the line where the wrapper session is instantiated, from:

```python
sess = SomeWrapperSession(parameter_a, parameter_b)
wrapper = AWrapperInstance(session=sess)
```

to:

```python
# Once the server is properly setup
sess = TransportSessionClient(SomeWrapperSession, host, port,
                              parameter_a, parameter_b)
wrapper = AWrapperInstance(session=sess)
```

## Syntactic layer

This layer is in direct communication with the backend.
It has no ontological knowledge and must just provide a simple interface for the interoperability layer to interact with the wrapped application.

This means it may have to be a binding if the application is in a different language.
It could also be a file generator/parser for backends that only allow file i/o.
In other cases, (e.g. LAMMPS with PyLammps) it is provided by the backend itself, and requires no implementation.

Since the syntactic layer will greatly depend on the specific backend, no standardisation is provided there.
