    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "CUDS stands for Common Universal Data Structure, and it is used to uniformly represent an ontological individual. In the python implementation of OSP-core, it means that every ontological individual is an instance of the `Cuds` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conceptually, we consider CUDS objects as containers. The content of a CUDS object consists of other CUDS objects. This means that a CUDS is a [recursive data structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_data_type). There are various types of relationships between a container and its contained objects. We will see this later on.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a data structure, CUDS exposes an API that provides the functionalities *Create*, *Read*, *Update* and *Delete* (or simply [CRUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete)).\n",
    "Except *Create*, all the other functionalities are supported by the methods `add`, `get`, `remove`, `update` and `iter`, that are defined in the class `Cuds`. Here, we cover all of the methods except `update` since it is used to synchronize between two or more data sources, and in this tutorial we will only use one, that is the data we will create through our python code on the fly. Check out the [wrapper tutorial](multiple-wrappers.ipynb) to see the `update` method in action.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every CUDS object is related to an ontological concept via the ontological `is a` relation.\n",
    "In the python implementation of OSP-core, all ontological concepts are instances of the `OntologyEntity` class.\n",
    "The ontological concept that can be used to *Create* CUDS objects are instances of `OntologyClass`, a subclass of `OntologyEntity`.\n",
    "The ontological concepts are organized in namespaces."
