    "# Tutorial 03: Sessions and variables\n",
    "In this tutorial we will explain how objects and the variables assigned to them behave with different sessions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "Some use cases of OSP-core, like coupling and linking, require interaction between multiple sessions. Even using just one wrapper usually means working with the default CoreSession initially, and then the wrapper session.\n",
    "\n",
    "When an object from one session is added to a different one, a deepcopy of the object is carried out. This means that both objects are technically the same at that point (same uid, oclas, relationships...), but reside in different memory areas and can theoretically differ in the future. The purpose of this behaviour is to allow selective synching and enable different sessions to have different states of an instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables that point to an object in the origin session will keep pointing to it (and not to the added session) unless explicitedly updated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we will try to explain said behaviour with simple illustrative examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "**_Note:_ This tutorial is not meant to be run like the others. The session classes and ontology entities are not real implementations. However, the behaviour shown will be the same as that of a real setup.**"
