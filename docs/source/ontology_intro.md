# Introduction on ontologies

What is an ontology?

An ontology defines a set of representational primitives with which to
model a domain of knowledge or discourse. The representational
primitives are typically classes (or sets), attributes (or properties),
and relationships (or relations among class members). The definitions of
the representational primitives include information about their meaning
and constraints on their logically consistent application. (Source:
