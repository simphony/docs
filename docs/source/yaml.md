# Description of YAML format specification

This file describes how you can create ontologies using YAML.

```eval_rst
.. tip::
   If you have an ontology where all entity names are in ALL_UPPERCASE,
   you can use the commandline tool `yaml2camelcase` that is shipped with
   OSP-core to transform it to an ontology with CamelCase entity names.
```

## Introduction

In this file we will give a description of how an Ontology can be
represented in a yaml file format and how to interpret such files. For
simplicity reasons in the following we will give examples from the
**\* example ontology \*** file which can be found in osp/core/ontology/yml/ontology.city.yml.

## Naming of the files and installation

Name any ontology `<name>.ontology.yml`, where `<name>` should be replaced by a user defined name.

Then you can use pico to install the tool [Pico](#pico-installs-cuds-ontologies)
to install the ontology:

```sh
pico install </path/to/my_ontology.ontology.yml>
```

## Syntax of the .yml ontology

`version`: string

> Contains semantic version Major.minor in format M.m with M and m
> positive integers. minor MUST be incremented when backward
> compatibility in the format is preserved. Major MUST be incremented
> when backward compatibility is removed. Due to the strict nature of
> the format, a change in minor is unlikely.

`namespace`: string

> Defines the namespace of the current file. We recommend to use
  all_lowercase for the namespace name, with underscore as separation.
  All entities defined in this file will live in the namespace defined here.

`requirements`: List[string]

> A list of namespaces that this namespace depends on.

`author`: string

> Reference to the person(s) who created the file.

`ontology`: dict

> Contains individual declarations for ontology entities as a mapping.
> Each key of the mapping is the name of an ontology entity.
> The key can contain letters, numbers and underscore.
> By convention, they should be in CamelCase. The name of ontology classes
> should start with an uppercase latter, while the name of relationships
> and attributes should start with a lower case letter.
> This key is later used the reference the entity from within OSP-core
> in a case sensitive manner.
> The value of the mapping is a mapping whose format is detailed in the
> [Ontology entities format](#ontology-entities-format).

## Ontology entities format

Every declaration of an ontology entity must have the following keys:

`description`: string
> For human consumption. An ontological short description of the carried
> semantics. Should have the form: entity is a superclass\_entity that
> has \<differentiating\> terms.
>
`subclass_of`: List[**\`\`qualified entity name\`\`**].
> Its value is fixed on the ontology level.
>
> The subclass keyword expresses an **ontological is-a**
> relation. MUST be a list of a fully qualified strings referring to another entity.
> Only the entity `cuba.entity` is allowed to have no superclass. See [CUBA namespace](#the-cuba-namespace).
>
> If entity A is a subclass of B and B is subclass of C,
> then A is also subclass of C.

An ontology entity can be either a relationship, a cuds entity or an attribute.
Depending on that the mapping can have further keys.
For cuds entities these keys are described in
[CUDS entities format](#cuds-classes-format) section.
For relationship entities, these keys are described in
[Relationship format](#relationship-format) section.
For attributes, these keys are described in
[Attribute format](#attribute-format) section.

## The CUBA namespace

The CUBA namespace contains a set of Common Universal Basic entities, that have special meaning in OSP-core.
The CUBA namespace is always installed in OSP-core.

`cuba.Entity`
> The root for all ontology classes. Does not have a superclass.

`cuba.Nothing`
> An ontology class, that is not allowed to have individuals.

`cuba.relationship`
> The root of all relationships. Does not have a superclass.

`cuba.attribute`
> The root of all attributes. Does not have a superclass.

`cuba.Wrapper`
> The root of all wrappers. These are the bridge to simulation engines and databases. See the examples in examples/.

`cuba.activeRelationship`
> The root of all active relationships. Active relationships express that one cuds object is in the container of another.

`cuba.passiveRelationship`
> The inverse of `cuba.activeRelationship`.

## Attribute format

Every attribute is a subclass of `cuba.attribute`.
The declaration of an attribute is a special case of the declaration of an entity.
It must have the keys described in [Ontology entities format](#ontology-entities-format).
It can additionally have the following keys:

`datatype`: string

> It is an attribute of an entity in cases when the datatype of said
> entity is important.
>
> Describes the datatype of the value that a certain entity can take. It
> can be one of the following:
>
> - `BOOL`: a form of data with only two possible values (usually
>   \"true\" or \"false\")
> - `INT`: a positive or negative integer number.
> - `FLOAT`: a number containing values on both sides of the decimal
>   point
> - `STRING`: a sequence of characters that can also contain spaces and
>   numbers. The length can be specified with "STRING:LENGTH" (e.g.
>   STRING:20 means the length of the string should be maximum 20
>   characters).
> - `VECTOR:datatype:D1:D2:...:Dn`: a vector of the given dimensions
>   (D1 x D2 x ... x Dn) and the given datatype.
>   The dimensions are always fixed.
>
>   For example, a VECTOR:INT:4:2:1 would be: \
>   { [(a), (b)],  [(c), (d)], [(e), (f)], [(g), (h)] } \
>   where all elements (a, b, ...) are integers.
>   (the different delimiters are only used for visual purposes).
>   If no datatype is specified, it would be a `FLOAT` vector.
>
> In case a datatype is not specified the default datatype is assumed to
> be STRING
>
> For example: The datatype of entity numberOfOccurrences is INT.

> ```eval_rst
>.. note::
>   The implementation of the vectors is experimental and will be updated as soon as 
>   EMMO has established an appropriate wait of representing them
> ```

## Class expressions

A class expression describes a subset of individuals.
They are similar to classes, but do not have a name in the ontology.
Class expressions will be used in [CUDS entities format](#cuds-classes-format) and [Relationship format](#relationship-format).
They can be either:

- A **\`\`qualified entity name\`\`** of a class. In this case it corresponds to all individuals of referenced class.
- Requirements on the individual's relationships. For example:

  ```yaml
  city.hasInhabitant:
    cardinality: 1+
    range: city.Citizen
    exclusive: false
  ```

  This describes the set of individuals that have at least one citizen as inhabitant.
  In general it describes the individuals which have some relationship to some object.
  It is a mapping from the **\`\`qualified entity name\`\`** of a relationship to the following keywords:

  `range`
  > A class expression describing the individuals which are object of the relationship.

  `cardinality`
  > The number of times individuals defined in `range` is allowed to be a object of the relationship.
  > To define the `cardinality` we use the following syntax:
  >
  > - many / * / 0+ (default): Zero to infinity target objects are allowed.
  > - some / \+ / 1+: At least one target object is required.
  > - ? / 0-1: At most one target object is allowed.
  > - a+: At least a target objects are required.
  > - a-b: At least a and at most b target objects are required (i.e. inclusive).
  > - a: Exactly a target objects are required.

  `exclusive`
  > Whether the given `target` is the only allowed object.
- A composition of several class expressions. For example:

  ```yaml
  or:
    - city.City
    - city.Neighborhood
  ```

  This is the union of all individuals that are a city or a neighbourhood.
  We use the keyword `or` for union, `and` for intersection and `not` for complement.
  After `or` and `and`, a list of  class expressions for the union / intersection is expected.
  After `not` a single class expression is expected.

The definition of class expressions is recursive. For example:

```yaml
or:
  - city.City
  - city.hasPart:
      cardinality: 1+
      range: city.Neighborhood
      exclusive: false
```

This describes the set of all individuals that are a city or have a neighbourhood.

## CUDS classes format

The declaration of a cuds entity is a special case of the declaration of an entity.
It must have the keys described in [Ontology entities format](#ontology-entities-format).
It can contain further information:

`attributes`: Dict[**\`\`qualified entity name\`\`**, default_value]
> Expects a mapping from the **\`\`qualified entity name\`\`** of an attribute to its default.
> Each key must correspond to a subclass of `attribute`. For example:
>
> ```yaml
> Address:
>   ...
>   attributes:
>     city.name: "Street"
>     city.number:
> ```
>
> Here, an address has a name and a number.
> The default name is "Street", the number has no default.
> If no default is given, the user is forced to specify a value each time he creates an individual.

`subclass_of`: List[Class expression]
> In addition to qualified entity names of classes, class expressions are also allowed.
> These class expressions restrict the individuals allowed in the class. Only those
> individuals are allowed that are in the intersection of the class expressions. For example:
>
> ```yaml
> PopulatedPlace:
>    description:
>    subclass_of:
>    - city.GeographicalPlace
>    - city.hasInhabitant:
>        range: city.Citizen
>        cardinality: many
>        exclusive: true
> ```
>
> Here, a populated place is a geographical place which must have citizens as inhabitants.

`disjoint_with`: List[Class expression]
> A list of class expressions that are not allowed to share any individuals with the cuds entity.

`equivalent_to`: List[Class expression]
> A list of class expressions who contain the same individuals as the cuds entity. For example:
>
> ```yaml
> PopulatedPlace:
>    description:
>    equivalent_to:
>    - city.GeographicalPlace
>    - city.hasInhabitant:
>        range: city.Citizen
>        cardinality: many
>        exclusive: true
> ```
>
> Here every geographical place that has citizens as inhabitants is automatically a populated place.

## Relationship format

Every relationship is a subclass of `cuba.relationship`.
The declaration of a relationship is a special case of the declaration of an entity.
It must have the keys described in [Ontology entities format](#ontology-entities-format).
Furthermore, it can contain the following information:

`inverse`: **\`\`qualified entity name\`\`** or empty (None)
> If CUDS object A is related to CUDS object B via relationship `rel`, then B is related
> with A via the inverse of `rel`.
>
> For example: The inverse of `hasPart` is `isPartOf`.
>
> If no inverse is given, OSP-core will automatically create one.

`domain`: Class expression
> A class expression describing the individuals that are allowed to be a subject of the relationship.
> If multiple class expressions are given, the relationship's domain is the intersection of the class expressions.

`range`: Class expression
> A class expression describing the individuals that are allowed to be object of the relationship.
> If multiple class expressions are given, the relationship's range is the intersection of the class expression.

`characteristics`: String
> A list of characteristics of the relationship. The following characteristics are supported:
>
> - reflexive
> - symmetric
> - transitive
> - functional
> - irreflexive
> - asymmetric
> - inversefunctional

A subclass of a relationship is called a sub-relationship.

## Limitations

`Class expressions`, `domain`, `range`, `characteristics`, `equivalent_to`, `disjoint_with`
are currently not parsed by OSP-core.
