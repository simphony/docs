    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial introduces the use of multiple data sources, and shows how can one exchange information between them. The code given here is based on [this example](https://github.com/simphony/osp-core/blob/master/examples/multiple_wrappers_example.py) and builds on the [introduction on the CUDS API](./cuds_api.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "One of the main strengths of CUDS objects is their ability to share information between different underlying data sources interchangeably.\n",
    "Using OSP-core's inner workings a data source can be represented as a CUDS object.\n",
    "A data source can be in turn a database, a simulation engine, or any other software package, which is able to either generate or store information.\n",
    "\n",
    "We refer to a CUDS object, which represents an underlying data source as a **wrapper**, as it wraps around the data source.\n",
    "Wrappers use the CUDS API with the addition to some wrapper-specific methods, which will be discussed later on in this tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a wrapper to be initialized, one needs some context for the underlying data source (e.g. location, credentials, etc.) for this we introduce an object called **session**.\n",
    "Conceptually a session can be thought as an interoperability level, or in simple terms it handles the transition from the user-friendly CUDS API to the more task-specific syntax data sources tend to have."

The magic happens in the following `run` method, which recognise that **Peter** is a person and it then transforms him into a citizen of the **EMMO town**. This new information is then stored in the `sim_emmo_town` automatically within the `run` method. We then output the information about Peter, who is now a citizen of **EMMO town**.\n",

In our case it will find its new citizen **Peter** and it will add it to the **EMMO town** in the database instance of the town, `db_emmo_town`.
